         <h2>Chapter 2 </h2>
         <p> Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
             desk, laying between the copies of <i> Nature </i>. <i> New Scientist</i>,
             and all the other scientific oumals her work had appeared in, was a well
             thumbed copy of <cite> On The Road </cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
             since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt
             she needed to be free. </p>
             <p> She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an
                 Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q> Work is the refuge of people who have
                 nothing better to do </q>. Although many considered her pioneering work,
                 unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleeic acid"> DNA </abbr>
                 to be an outstanding achievement. Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better
                 to do. </p>
