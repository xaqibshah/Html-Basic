        <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
        <p>
            A potageer is a French term for an omamental vegatable or kitchen garden.
            Often flowers (adible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the veetable
            to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing
            food aesthetically pleasing.

        <h2>What to Plant </h2>
        <p>
            Plants are chosen as much for their functionality at for their color and form. 
            Many are trained to grow upward. A well designed potager can provide foor, out
            flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potahers can disguise
            their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms - from the carefree 
            style of the cottage garden to the formally of a knot garden.
